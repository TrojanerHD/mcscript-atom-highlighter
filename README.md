# Highlighter for MCScript in Atom
This is a highlighter for .[mcscript](http://stevertus.com/mcscript)-files. The theme is based on [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

Thanks to [MrYurihi](https://github.com/MrYurihi/): I copied a lot from his/her [highlighting for mcfunctions](https://github.com/MrYurihi/mcfunction) for the autocomplete-feature.
